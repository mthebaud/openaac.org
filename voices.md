## Open/Free Synthesized Voices

Most operating systems now have built-in speech synthesis engines, which
is great! Some of the most common languages are supported by default,
and large comapnies like Apple, Google and Microsoft often compete
over speech synthesis quality, so some of the highest-quality speech
engines are available for free already.


There are also proprietary companies who license
custom voices, including child-aged or gender-neutral voices, for
many languages.

However, there are some languages that haven't been implemented,
and sometimes users want to sound different than just the standard
system voice, so it makes sense to provide additional voice
output options. Additionally, some AAC users want to utilize
an AAC system that hasn't licensed these extended libraries of 
voices.

There are a few cross-platform, open source speech synthesis libraries,
but those that can run across platforms are often very old and
very computer-y. One promising library is <a href="https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS">Coqui TTS</a>, which currently
requires the python runtime library and 
<a href="https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS/discussions/407">doesn't run in mobile environments</a>.
We hope to find developers who would be willing to address this shortcoming
and open up a broader range of voices to AAC users. If you can help with
that effort, please join or Slack channel and let us know!
