## Research and Surveys

At OpenAAC we regularly run surveys to collect data across
the industry. The more participation we have, the more
accurate and useful our results will be! Please consider
filling out any of the current surveys we have running that
apply to you. You may also share these surveys online or
with your social circles!

We believe that information is important and valuable for
everyone, so we always make public the results of any
surveys or research we conduct. You can review any of the
results of current or past survyes using the provided links.

discover areas where they could improve in their efforts.
