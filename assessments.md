## AAC Systems

There are many varied assessment tools used to evaluate an AAC user's
development. Some
assessments are interactive, some are paper-based, etc. Many,
however, are proprietary and require either an up-front purchase,
or a subscription. In line with our initiative at OpenAAC to provide
free, open-licensed resources for families and practitioners, we are 
developing and collecting a library of free assessment tools, based 
on industry best practices. Our goal, as always, is to provide
resources that can help AAC users be enabled and empowered in 
their personal communication strategy.

### Communication Partner Profile (CPP v1)

<a href="/assets/cppv1.pdf"><img src="/images/cpp_preview.png" style='max-width: 100%; border-left: 5px solid #a00;'/></a>

OpenAAC's first Open Assessment project is the 
<a href="/assets/cppv1.pdf">Communication Partner Profile</a> 
(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7b1bVpT49kCpViXRk4q6PfJu4GzmZG-/view">preview</a>). This assessment form is intended as a self-reflection tool that communication partners can
fill out to help look for areas where they may be able to
better support AAC users. The questions are based on a collection of
research and best practices regarding AAC supports (references included)
and feedback from AAC users and practitioners.

Try it for yourself! The CPP is <b>free to use and share</b> so please distribute it
to those who could benefit! The CPP is available as a downloadable
pdf (128Kb) but can also be added to any online assessment tools
as long as you provide proper attribution.

If you have suggestions or feedback, <a href="https://forms.gle/Ve6UuETYksWD5drn7">please share them with 
us</a>. We are continuing to improve upon the CPP and appreciate
additional perspectives.
