## AAC Systems

There are many varied assessment tools used to evaluate an AAC user's
development, either as a one-time assessmet or over time. Some
assessments are interactive, some are paper-based, etc. Most,
however, are proprietary and require either an up-front purchase,
or a subscription. We don't intend to replace all of these
resources, many of which can be very helpful as support teams
looks for opportunities to help AAC users develop their
communication skills based on their individual needs.

### Communication Partner Profile (CPP v1)

OpenAAC's first Open Assessment project is the 
<a href="/assets/cppv1.pdf">Communication Partner Profile</a> 
(<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-7b1bVpT49kCpViXRk4q6PfJu4GzmZG-/view">preview</a>). This assessment form is intended as a self-reflection tool that communication partners can
fill out to help look for areas where they may be able to
better support AAC users. The questions are based on a collection of
research and best practices regarding AAC supports (references included)
and feedback from AAC users and practitioners.

Try it for yourself! The CPP is <b>free to use and share</b> so please distribute it
to those who could benefit! The CPP is available as a downloadable
pdf (128Kb) but can also be added to any online assessment tools
as long as you provide proper attribution.
